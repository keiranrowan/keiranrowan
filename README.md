# Keiran Rowan

Hi, I'm Keiran. I'm currently a Systems Analyst for Collier County Public Schools. My daily driver is Fedora Linux and I spend most of my time hacking away in Emacs. When I'm at work I am writing COBOL on an IBM i mid-range mainframe. In my personal projects, I prefer to use C, Golang, and Haskell, but I do like to write some GNU COBOL if I get the chance. I love creating open source software and contributing to niche projects. I like working with older technologies and finding ways to get more mileage out of legacy software and hardware.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ILE RPG, REXX, and IBM i Systems Administration.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source software
